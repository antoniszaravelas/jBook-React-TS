# jBook-React-TS

## Description

My motivation to build this jBook project was my curiosity about how other web apps like Codepen or CodesandBox work and at the same time I wanted to depeen my knowledge on Technologies such as 

* React + Typescript
* Code Transpilation (ESBUILD,  Webpack)
* IFrames
* Caching using IndexedDB
* React + Redux + Typescript
* Dynamic Design Patterns etc.


## Installation

To get the application running simply clone the repository and

```bash
npm jsnote serve
```

After that you will be asked to navigate to http://localhost:4005 to start working around the file 

## Dependencies

* cors
* express
* http-proxy-middleware

and many others as **devDevependencies** (have a look at my package.json file).
